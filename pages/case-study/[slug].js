                  <h4>Predictive Analytics and Disease Prevention</h4>
                  <p>
                    One of the most prominent applications of AI in healthcare
                    is in diagnostic imaging. AI algorithms have demonstrated
                    remarkable proficiency in interpreting medical images such
                    as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. They can identify anomalies
                    and deviations that might be overlooked by the human eye.
                    This is particularly valuable in early disease detection.
                    For instance, AI can aid radiologists in detecting minute
                    irregularities in mammograms or identifying critical
                    findings in chest X-rays, potentially indicative of
                    life-threatening conditions.
